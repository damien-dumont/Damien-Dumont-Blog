## III - ANALYSIS TABLE ABOUT THE STUDY:

| Researchers? | Thomas Carell & al |
|-|-|
| Published in? When (if mentioned)? | Science, October 3, 2019 |
| General topic | RNA synthesis, origin of life |
| Procedure/what was examined | The team made some experiment and tried to find a chemical pathway for RNA synthesis, which is a candidate to explain how life may have appeared. They first found a way for the nucleobases to appear, but the pathway for A and G, and for U and C, are incompatible. |
| Conclusion/discovery | Carrel's team successfully found a way to create all nucleobases through a seemingly natural chemical pathway. |
| Remaining questions | RNA isn't only nucleobases, but also sugar (ribose). How did it appear? Some researchers doubt it might be the best explanation as to how did life appear. |
