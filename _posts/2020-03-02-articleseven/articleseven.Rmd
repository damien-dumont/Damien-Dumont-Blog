| General topic | Upgrading telescopes to scan the entire sky to look if some habitables planets carries life forms. |
| Procedure/what was examined | A new telescope will be built to look the entire sky all the time, allowing to analyse the atmosphere of planets to search traces of gases produced by living organisms thanks to the future James Webb Telescope, an observation satellite. |
| Conclusion/discovery | The ground satellite have yet to be built and the James Webb Telescope has yet to be launched. They will start by looking at planets from the Trappist-1 system, 3 of which being in the habitable zone of the system. |
| Remaining questions | Some scientists like Stephen Hawking believe it would be a bad idea to contact them. |
