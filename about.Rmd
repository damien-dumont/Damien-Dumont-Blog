title: "About me"

My name is Dumont Damien. I'm a university student, currently in second cycle of bachelor in the University of Mons for the 2019-2020 academic year. My teacher is Ms Ingrid Van Lancker, and I am in group 1. I am going to talk about the apparition of life, or at least the possibility of it, outside of the Earth.
