| General topic | Discover alien structures using a probe |
| Procedure/what was examined | NASA launched a space probe in april 18 "on a mission to hunt for alien planets circling bright, relatively nearby stars", using the transit method (the probe "looks for slight dips in star brightness caused when an orbiting planet crosses the star's face") |
| Conclusion/discovery | To this date (Oct 23), the probe has discovered "1,000 "objects of interest," 29 of which are confirmed alien planets." |
| Remaining questions | The team has to be careful not to confuse possible alien megastructures, and natural phenomena, like an asteroid field for example. |
